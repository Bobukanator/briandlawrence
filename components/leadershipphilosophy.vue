      Brian Lawrence’s Leadership Philosophy
    </h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        If you ask 100 people what makes a great leader, you will get 100
        different answers. What it means to be a leader and what makes a great
        leader is subjective however some traits and attributes stand out above
        others. I have spent much of my career attempting to learn what makes a
        genuine leader. I have learned from mentors, leadership books, and from
        my own mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leadership philosophy was created to help articulate what my
        definition of a great leader is. The benefit of having this written on
        paper is to remind myself so that I can walk the walk while informing
        those that work with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important leadership attributes that govern me as a leader are
        trust, purpose, and passion. Trust within a team is the glue that holds
        the team together. Having purpose provides the fuel that enables
        satisfaction in your work. Passion is the hard work that creates
        success.

      The following are the commitments I make to my fellow associates using
      these attributes as a guide:
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <b>Trust</b>
      <ul>
        <li>I will try to set expectations for what I expect from you.</li>
        <li>I will do my best to understand your expectations of me.</li>
        <li>
          I will take 100% responsibility for my action and my team's actions.
        </li>
        <li>I will be transparent with decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Purpose</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Purpose is the reason for why something exists. I commit to helping
          associates understand the company purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          I commit to following my purpose and helping others define and
          understand theirs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Passion</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Passion is the hard work, but hard work without direction and control
          is not sufficient which is why I view time as a vital resource; it is
          critical to focus your hard work and time on the right things. I will
          do my best to evaluate where I am spending my time to be as efficient
          as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will do whatever I can do to remove barriers to our progress as a
          team and your progress towards your goals and personal development.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">

          Continue to learn - Tim Ferris once said that the opposite of
          happiness is not sadness, it is boredom. If you continue to learn, you
          will never be bored and always be happy plus you will improve yourself
          and as a result your life and our team!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A mentor of mine once told me that authentic leaders create more
        leaders, I embrace this perspective and strive to create more leaders. I
        will continue to improve this philosophy and my self by learning through
        every avenue which may include asking for feedback, reading, taking
        courses, and learning from experiencing.

            I joined YouTube in 2007 and uploaded my first video. After reading
            Gary V's book, "Crush It," I decided to try to become an influencer.
            I started posting videos about my travel, my speeches (once I joined
            Toastmasters), and some software coding talks. One day, I posted a
            fun video I made of a person in a dinosaur costume at a local radio
            station event. That video went viral with over 2 million views, this
            helped boost visits & subscribers to my channel. I still have this
            channel today and recently have posted about Spain, UX design, and
            the occasional cooking video. I have not become a true influencer,
            BUT I love making and posting videos.

            <br />
            As I progressed in my career at Siemens, I realized that much of
            what I was learning should be shared. So, I started a blog called
            Young Professional Career (YPCareer.com). In addition, I decided to
            use a multi-channel marketing approach and created a video blog
            using the same content called SolutionShortz aka SSZ.TV. Over
            several years, I created around 40 articles, some of which were also
            turned into youtube and
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/bobukanator">vimeo</a> videos.

            One of my favorite blog posts,
            <a
              href="https://ezinearticles.com/?Finding-a-Job-and-Social-Media&id=6261292"
              >"The Traditional Resume is Quickly Becoming Obsolete,"</a
            >
            led me to start a new project called "Your Social Media Resume." The
            idea was to create a website that would scan your social media
            presence and provide a score along with guidance on improving your
            social media footprint. I pitched the idea to three computer science
            students at Drexel University. They liked the concept, and we
            started converting my original prototype to Java while working on a
            marketing plan. Unfortunately, the team was busy with other
            commitments, and we did not make much progress before the team
            dissolved.

            <strong>2012-2018 Career Boot Camp Coaches LLC</strong>
            <small>Startup</small>
            <br />
            After launching and running a successful career development program
            at Siemens, my colleague and I decided to see if we could turn our
            passion into a full-time career. So we formed Career Boot Camp
            Coaches LLC. Our vision was "to empower and inspire individuals to
            harness their career potential." We spent our nights and weekends
            creating a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VCcvHUBn1eV3a_EL-iHQnkP1SaHfMeG/view?usp=sharing">two-day workshop</a> (Bootcamp) focused on self-discovery and
            self-direction. After a couple of years, we decided to pivot and
            convert our boot camp into an online digital career coach. We had
            two additional founders join us with marketing and machine learning
            backgrounds and created <a href="https://careerinformatics.com/about">career informatics</a>, an online digital career
            coach. <br /><br />
            The digital coach consisted of the following features:
            <ul>
            <li>Ability to parse Resume & Linkedin Profile automatically saving
            skills to your profile Integration with Indeed jobs searching jobs
            based on your skills and target job to return jobs the user is
            qualified for
            </li><li>Interview assistant that asked tailored questions
            based on the job user is interested in</li><li>Machine learning features
            learned which jobs the user was interested in tweaking the results
            based on user preferences</li> 
            </ul><br />
            After countless nights and weekends,
            brainstorming sessions, and unsuccessful partnerships, the team
            decided to focus on other parts of our lives, and the company was
            dissolved in 2018.

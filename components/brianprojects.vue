            I joined YouTube in 2007 and uploaded my first video. After reading
            Gary V's book, "Crush It," I decided to try to become an influencer.
            I started posting videos about my travel, my speeches (once I joined
            Toastmasters), and some software coding talks. One day, I posted a
            fun video I made of a person in a dinosaur costume at a local radio
            station event. That video went viral with over 2 million views, this
            helped boost visits & subscribers to my channel. I still have this
            channel today and recently have posted about Spain, UX design, and
            the occasional cooking video. I have not become a true influencer,
            BUT I love making and posting videos.

            <br />
            As I progressed in my career at Siemens, I realized that much of
            what I was learning should be shared. So, I started a blog called
            Young Professional Career (YPCareer.com). In addition, I decided to
            use a multi-channel marketing approach and created a video blog
            using the same content called SolutionShortz aka SSZ.TV. Over
            several years, I created around 40 articles, some of which were also
            turned into a youtube video.

            <br />
            One of my favorite blog posts, "The Traditional Resume is Quickly
            Becoming Obsolete," led me to start a new project called Your Social
            Media Resume (transitioning to Social Folio). The idea was to create
            a website that would scan your social media presence and provide a
            score along with guidance on how to fix and or improve your social
            media footprint! This project was the first time I created a team to
            help. I took the concept to some of my friends at Drexel University
            who were still students and pitched the idea. I had a rough
            prototype created and sold it. We then started to produce a better
            version using Java instead of PHP WordPress plugin code. This
            project eventually fell apart as we could not commit as a team with
            our busy schedules! It was fun, though, and I still think it could
            have been a fantastic product if only we were more focused!

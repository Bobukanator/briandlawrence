            In 2006, I was selected to participate in Siemens Learning Campus @
            Healthcare. Learning Campus was a selective 18 month training
            internal program for dynamic and motivated employees early in their
            careers who have potential for future leadership positions. It was
            during this program that I was exposed to various career development
            workshops. I found that I truly loved learning more about myself and
            then taking that information and figuring out what I really wanted
            to do with my career going forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, I started incorporating what I had learned into my
            daily life. I had also co-founded an employee resource group at the
            time for young professionals at Siemens. A significant focus of our
            group was to help other employees with their careers. I took some of
            the concepts I had learned and created a career-focused boot camp
            program. The program paired employees with a coach. It was very
            successful, with over 100 employees coached through this program. I
            coached many employees over several years and trained new coaches as
            the program expanded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, this program was handed over to a new leader, and I
            moved on; however, I continued to use what I learned, coaching
            whenever I had an opportunity. This approach was helpful as I
            entered management and shared the career development techniques with
            my team members. In 2012, a colleague and I later founded a
            career-focused startup named Career Boot Camp Coaches LLC. We both
            had a passion for coaching others in their career and decided to see
            if we could take this passion and turn it into our full-time jobs.

            The first product of Career Boot Camp Coaches was a

              >two-day career workshop</a
            >
            designed to equip individuals with the knowledge to create a
            realistic written career plan. Workshop topics were organized around
            self-discovery and self-direction, relying on activities such as
            <a

              >MBTI</a

              >Career Anchors</a
            >, Mind mapping, SWOT, and career roadmap creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a couple of years, the startup shifted focus and pivoted to
            creating a digital career coach integrated with Indeed.com and
            LinkedIn. The digital coach took concepts from the boot camp and
            created digital versions. The interview assistant is embedded in the
            current version of
            <a href="http://careerinformatics.com">CareerInformatics.com</a>
            today, which is still supported by me for fun.

            On another occasion at Siemens, I was invited to join a training
            class on coaching. We were taught how to coach for performance,
            coach for career development, and coach to solve complex corporate
            problems. We were introduced to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_model">GROW</a> model
            and spent several days learning from our teacher and practicing with
            each other. I thoroughly enjoyed the training and immediately
            started trying it out with my team and peers. However, one of the
            challenges I experienced was remembering powerful questions I could
            utilize as I practiced this new art. So sometime around 2013, I
            created a Tumblr blog and a Twitter account and started collecting
            powerful questions from anywhere I could find them. You can visit
            the revised (for 2022) site at
            <a href="http://powerful-questions.com">powerful-questions.com</a>.

            In January of 2023, I joined
            <a href="https://mento.co">Mento.co</a> as a leadership and
            engineering career coach. Mento is a fantastic learning and
            development company that combines mentorship and coaching from

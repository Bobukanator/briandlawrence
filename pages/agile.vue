            I started working in Healthcare IT in 2002. For the first couple of
            years, I spent a TON of time creating various prototypes along with
            Requirements and Functional documentation. At that time, the way was
            waterfall. This approach was the norm until sometime in 2005 when
            Siemens Healthcare started to adopt an Agile approach to software
            development.

            Being in a large corporation had some advantages. One of those
            advantages was a large budget to hire experts in the Industry. At
            that time, I was introduced to who I consider Agile development
            celebrities like
            <a href="https://www.jbrains.ca/">J.B. Rainsberger</a> (TDD expert
            and author of JUnit Recipes),
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmicah/">Micah Martin</a>,
            and
            <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/mdevos"
              >Martine Devos</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I learned more from those experts and experience, I transitioned
            from a software engineer to a scrum master. I became heavily
            involved in the world of burndowns, sprint backlogs, and scrum
            boards and became a certified scrum master. During that time, I was
            collaborated with my fellow scrum masters and facilitated a virtual
            scrum master team where we shared successes and challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, I entered management but continued to be an agile advocate
            ensuring that my development teams had the support they needed for
            success. Over the years, I managed several scrum masters coaching as
            necessary. In 2016, I became the manager of a large User Experience
            team and had an opportunity to explore how design and agile could
            work together. During that time, the organization (Cerner - which
            purchased our Siemens division in 2015) started to realign the
            software development approach at the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The realignment resulted in a strong focus on agile and the product
            lifecycle. This change opened up new opportunities, and I became
            part of a change management leadership group representing UX. In
            September of 2020, I was able to take a scrum product owner course
            and became a
            <a

              >Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)</a
            >
            through Scrum Alliance.

            I am available to advise or coach teams entering their agile
            development journey. Agile at scale isn't easy, but I have been part
            of those initiatives more than once and would be happy to share my
            experiences. I am especially familiar with UX/Design and Agile using
            Scrum and Kanban.

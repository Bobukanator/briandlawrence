Personal website built in VUE.js and NUXT 2

## art generator
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/art_generator
I created this with the goal of dabbling in python and tensorflow. This project loads and trains a prediction model based on CIFAR-10. 
I then use that prediction model to randomly generate images, one of each of the 10 types of images in CIFAR-10. I was originally thinking about using this to create NFTs on opensea. 

## cryptobots
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/cryptobots
I created some Node.js scripts (bots) along with a basic Solidity contract with the goal of better understanding the web3 / crypto space.

## web3 suite
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/web3suite
My vision for this project is to use it as a metaverse marketing tool. As I work with clients specific to metaverse and web3 branding, 
I will add to this project with the vision of eventually releasing this to other users when the time is right. 
Currently the web3 suite is an internal name and it is hosted on vercel here: https://web3suite.co/

## catetry
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/catetry
In an effort to learn more about NUXT3 and the ChatGPT API, I have created a web-based app that gives the user the ability to generate a poem about their cat using ChatGPT 3.5. 
Catetry was an idea that my wife and I had many years ago due to the fact we have cats and my wife spends time on Facebook in a Meezer (Siamese Cats) Mom community. 
Now that ChatGPT is available to the public, we have been able to take the idea and make it a reality. 
Currently it is hosted on vercel here: https://catetry.com/

## llm rails
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/llm_rails
This is a Ruby on Rails web application that is simply a wrapper for ruby-openai that integrates with ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo model. Not currently hosted anywhere.

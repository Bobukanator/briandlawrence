# Repositories

## briandlawrence
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/briandlawrence
Personal website built in VUE.js and NUXT 2
http://BrianDLawrence.com 

## art generator
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/art_generator
I created this with the goal of dabbling in python and tensorflow. This project loads and trains a prediction model based on CIFAR-10. 
I then use that prediction model to randomly generate images, one of each of the 10 types of images in CIFAR-10. I was originally thinking about using this to create NFTs on opensea. 

## cryptobots
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/cryptobots
I created some Node.js scripts (bots) along with a basic Solidity contract with the goal of better understanding the web3 / crypto space. 

## interview assistant
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/interviewassist
NUXT Version of the Interview Assistant originally designed and implemented 2012-2018 as part of Career Boot Camp Coaches LLC. 
This project is currently live hosted by vercel.com here: http://careerinformatics.com/

## powerful questions
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/powerfulquestions
This is a simple website that randomly loads powerful questions for use by anyone who has interest in coaching others. 
This project is currently live hosted by vercel.com here: http://powerful-questions.com/

## web3 suite
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/web3suite
My vision for this project is to use it as a metaverse marketing tool. As I work with clients specific to metaverse and web3 branding, 
I will add to this project with the vision of eventually releasing this to other users when the time is right. 
Currently the web3 suite is an internal name and it is hosted on vercel here: https://web3suite.vercel.app/

## catetry
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/catetry
In an effort to learn more about NUXT3 and the ChatGPT API, I have created a web-based app that gives the user the ability to generate a poem about their cat using ChatGPT 3.5. 
Catetry was an idea that my wife and I had many years ago due to the fact we have cats and my wife spends time on Facebook in a Meezer (Siamese Cats) Mom community. 
Now that ChatGPT is available to the public, we have been able to take the idea and make it a reality. 
Currently it is hosted on vercel here: https://catetry.vercel.app/
This will be transferred to catetry.com once I am ready with version 1.0 (Targetting June 2023)

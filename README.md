# Repositories

## briandlawrence
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/briandlawrence
Personal website built in VUE.js and NUXT 2
http://BrianDLawrence.com 

## art generator
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/art_generator
I created this with the goal of dabbling in python and tensorflow. This project loads and trains a prediction model based on CIFAR-10. 
I then use that prediction model to randomly generate images, one of each of the 10 types of images in CIFAR-10. Once I have the 
art generator creating images I like, I will create a new NFT collection on opensea.

I created some Node.js scripts (bots) along with a basic Solidity contract with the goal of better understanding the web3 / crypto space.

## web3 suite
https://github.com/BrianDLawrence/web3suite
My vision for this project is to use it as a metaverse marketing tool. As I work with clients specific to metaverse and web3 branding, 
I will add to this project with the vision of eventually releasing this to other users when the time is right. 
Currently the web3 suite is an internal name and it is hosted on vercel here: https://web3suite.vercel.app/
